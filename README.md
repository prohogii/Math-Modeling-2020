Copter model by Dostoyewski
---------------------------
Control parameters:<br>
1. `RollAngle` — rolling angle, used to set lateral velocity;<br>
2. `PitchAngle` — pitch angle, sets headway speed;<br>
3. `YawSpeed` — this is obvious;<br>
4. `Stabilize` — button that activates altitude hold mode;<br>
5. the side slider is required to set the vertical speed when the altitude hold mode is disabled.
